# Secure Company Network System Design and Implementation

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure company network system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network incorporates various essential components and security measures to simulate a real-world enterprise environment.

## Project Overview

This network design aims to provide a robust and secure communication infrastructure for a company.  It includes L2 and L3 switching, routing, firewall protection, VoIP integration, wireless access, and various security protocols to ensure data integrity and network availability.

## Features

* **Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switching:**  Utilizes VLANs for network segmentation and efficient traffic management. Layer 3 switches enable inter-VLAN routing for communication between different departments.
* **Routing:** Implements both static routing and dynamic routing protocols (OSPF) for efficient and adaptable network routing.
* **Firewall Security:** Deploys a Cisco ASA firewall to protect the network from external threats and unauthorized access.
* **High Availability:** Incorporates HSRP (Hot Standby Routing Protocol) to ensure network redundancy and failover in case of router failure.
* **Link Aggregation:** Employs LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) and EtherChannel to increase bandwidth and provide link redundancy between switches.
* **VoIP Integration:** Integrates VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) for internal communication, allowing employees to make calls over the network.
* **Wireless Access:** Provides secure wireless connectivity for employees using wireless access points.
* **Network Security:** Implements various security measures, including:
    * Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict network access and filter traffic.
    * Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), PortFast, and BPDU Guard to prevent switching loops and ensure network stability.
* **DHCP Server:** Configures a DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment, simplifying network administration.
